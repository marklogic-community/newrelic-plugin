Docs

`newrelic-marklogic-plugin docs on github <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin>`__

`newrelic-marklogic-plugin docs on pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic-marklogic-plugin>`__


Install, configure & run
------------------------

Install the plugin using any of the following methods.

- install from pypi repository

    ``pip install newrelic-marklogic-plugin``

- install direct from github

    ``pip install https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/archive/master.zip``

- download `release <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/releases>`__  (or clone) repository and run the following.

    ``python setup.py install``


Next step is to create and edit configuration file.

1) Copy
   `etc/newrelic\_marklogic.conf.sample <https://github.com/marklogic/newrelic-plugin/blob/master/etc/newrelic_marklogic.conf.sample>`__
   and to ``newrelic_marklogic.conf``

2) Edit ``newrelic_marklogic.conf`` ensuring correct MarkLogic
   connection details and NewRelic license key

Start reporting metrics to NewRelic by running the following.

    ``newrelic_marklogic.py -c newrelic_marklogic.conf``

Which samples metrics every period of length duration as set within configuration.

It is recommended to initiate plugin as a background task, run via a scheduler (ex. cron job) or using any other
approach appropriate for your environment.

Running with -h flag will emit usage instructions for running plugin.

    ``newrelic_marklogic.py -h``

::

    usage: ./newrelic_marklogic.py [-h] [-c config file] [-l log file]

    -h print usage instructions  (this message)
    -c config file               (default: newrelic_marklogic.conf)
    -l log file                  (default: newrelic_marklogic.log)

Usage
-----

The configuration file drives all newrelic-marklogic-plugin features and is split into several sections.

The 'marklogic' section contains connection details to MarkLogic server and Management REST API.

::

    [marklogic]

    # Scheme to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API (http|https).
    scheme = http

    # Host to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API (FQDN hostname).
    host = localhost

    # Port to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API.
    port = 8002

    # Authentication to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API (BASIC|DIGEST).
    auth= DIGEST

    # Username to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API.
    user = admin

    # Password to use when accessing MarkLogic management REST API.
    pass = admin

The 'newrelic' section specifies the NewRelic license key. Optionally you may nominate a proxy for accessing the NewRelic Plugin API.

::

    [newrelic]

    # Your NewRelic license key.
    key = ****************************************

    # Proxy (ex. http://10.10.1.10:3128).
    http_proxy =

The 'plugin' section defines sample period for updating NewRelic, as well as the logging level for emitting messages about plugin operation.
